%title Vim's understand

this is about my understand of vim, totally. every aspect.

vim is software, it needs compilation. when you compile vim's source code, you have a lot of choices, compile options.

what you choose deside what the vim looks like. almost every things can be change in vim.

so when talking about vim's configuration, it always like this: "if you compile your vim with the option xxx, this feature will act like yyy. if not, the feature will act like zzz.".

the point is that I just focus on the common features which most vim will have and most vim will be compiled with.

- [[directories_in__vim]]
- [[filetype_in_vim]]
